# nwHacks 2022 Project: Hercules

### By: Bob Pham, Jay Jang, Jay Esquivel, Nafis Ahsan

**Project Description:**
Our team decided to make an android app we call Hercules. Hercules is a "gamified" health tracking 
app, oriented towards those who struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Our app is engineered to
incentivize users to work out, diet, and develop healthy habits by rewarding them for fulfilling 
their fitness plans, or “questlines”, which are comprised of several tasks. Each user has a 
customizable avatar, and upon completion of certain goals, users will earn gold and experience
points that can be used to buy items at the shop and increase their character’s stats. We used java
to develop our app as it uses object-oriented design. Overall we tried to keep code relatively
simple but also developed an algorithm in which it becomes harder to earn rewards the more you 
progress.
